# IMDb Top 250 Movies



&emsp;The “IMDb Top 250 Movies” dataset was obtained from kaggle.com but originally sourced from IMDb.com/chart/top/. The dataset is made up of 23 columns, all of which represent a unique attribute about the movie being described by the row, such as the “Title,” “Year,”  “Director,” etc. For our instances, however, the focus will mostly be on the “Title”, “Actor,” “Genre,” “IMDb Votes”, “IMDb Rating,” “IMDb Votes,” and “Box Office” columns.  The “Title,”  “Actor,” and “Genre” data are all of the type string as the data is composed of words and names, while the “IMDb Rating,” “IMDb Votes,” and “Box Office” data is of type number. This is because the ratings are on a scale of 1-10 and allow for non-whole numbers, votes are counted individually based on IMDb users, and Box Office amount is usually a movie’s revenue (whole number) in the millions.\
&emsp;It is of note that the dataset does contain some null values for certain movies such as a missing “Box Office” amount or a lack of “Website” for the movie, so for our analysis, the specific movies that have this null data will be excluded.

## Question 1:
## What was the box office amount made by Leonardo DiCaprio movies rated in the top 250 of IMDb?

Importance of Question:\
&emsp;Question one helps better visualize the possible effect that results from the introduction of Leonardo DiCaprio in a movie that has a high overall rating. By examining the box office revenue generated by his past movies, studios can estimate the potential box office earnings of a film that features him as a lead actor. This analysis can help studios make informed decisions about hiring him or negotiating contracts with him.

Manipulations:\
&emsp;The data that is included in the bar chart is the name of the actor (which is filtered to include whatever cast Leonardo DiCaprio starred with, including him) and the Box Office data which depicts the revenue generated from each individual movie. 

Analysis & Conclusion:\
&emsp;From this data set, it is shown that Dicaprio’s Box Office numbers range from $57 million to $292 million. Leonardo DiCaprio can also be seen as a well-known actor since he stars in several top rated movies while also generating high sales.

## Question 2:
## Which production studios generated high box office numbers based on the top 250 movies?

Importance of Question:\
&emsp;Question two helps visualize the top production studios by box office numbers. By looking at this visualization, actors or producers may want to see what studio will make them the most money. Usually the production studios that make the most money have the best equipment and have the money to hire staff.  

Manipulations:\
&emsp;The data set is a bar chart that includes the production studio and the box office data which depicts the revenue that the production studio makes total from the movies produced. The SUM(Box Office) includes the total revenue from sales of the movies that made it in the top 250. Box Office was also filtered by between $300 million to $1 billion in order to leave out any null values and show the top few production studios that made the most sales. 

Analysis & Conclusion:\
&emsp;From this visualization, we can see that Walt Disney Pictures makes the most money by a landslide making over $2500 million while the rest are under $1000 million. Ultimately, producers will have better opportunities to increase their box office revenue if they pick Walt Disney Pictures.

## Question 3:

## Among the genres for the top 250 movies, which genres are the most preferred based on the average IMDB votes?
Importance of Question:\
&emsp;This question helps understand which genre or mix of genres receives the highest average vote in the dataset. This visual aid can help producers or writers plan out the overall theme of the movie by first deciding on a genre(s) that will probably lead to higher popularity. This graph will save producers/writers resources and will enhance their decision to create a more successful movie overall.
 
Manipulations: \
&emsp;The data included in this graph are the name of the genres and the average ratings for each genre within the top 250 movies data set. The reason the rating is being measured as an average instead of as a median is due to these very specific genres only having a small count of movies. This smaller count is better represented as an average. The graph shown is  filtered to only show genres in which there are more than five movies voted on. 


Analysis & Conclusion:\
&emsp;Overall, the box and whisker plot helped demonstrate how the “Action, Adventure, Fantasy” genre has the least spread and highest average in votes resulting in it being the most popular genre. This indicates that if producers want to make a successful movie they would increase their chances by filming an “Action, Adventure, Fantasy” movie.
